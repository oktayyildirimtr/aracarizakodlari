      <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The site is primarily static and informational. We do not require you to create an account or log in to read our content. When you visit the site, we or our service providers may collect the following types of information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical and usage data:</strong> Your IP address, browser type and version, device type, operating system, referring URL, pages visited, and approximate time spent on the site. This helps us understand how the site is used, fix technical issues, and improve performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> We may use cookies, local storage, or similar technologies for essential functions (e.g. remembering preferences), for analytics (e.g. counting visits), and for advertising if we use ad networks such as Google AdSense. For details, see our <a href={`/${ROUTES.en.cookieNotice}`}>Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact form and email:</strong> If you send us a message via our contact form or by email, we collect the information you provide (name, email address, subject, message content) solely to respond to your inquiry. We do not use this information for marketing unless you have given explicit consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="legal-basis">Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>
        Where the GDPR applies, we process your data on the following bases: (1) <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to operate and improve the site, ensure security, and analyse usage (e.g. via analytics); (2) <strong>Consent:</strong> where we use non-essential cookies or send marketing communications, we rely on your consent where required by law; (3) <strong>Contract:</strong> if you contact us, we process your data to handle your request; (4) <strong>Legal obligation:</strong> where we must retain or disclose data to comply with the law.
      </p>

      <h2 id="purpose">Purpose of Processing</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information we collect to: deliver and maintain the website; improve content and user experience; analyse traffic and usage patterns; ensure security and prevent abuse; respond to your messages; and comply with legal obligations. We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We may share data with service providers (e.g. hosting, analytics, or advertising partners) only to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, subject to appropriate agreements and, where required, your consent.
      </p>

      <h2 id="advertising">Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We may use third-party advertising services, such as Google AdSense, to display ads on the site. These services may use cookies and similar technologies to show relevant ads, measure ad performance, and build interest-based profiles. Google may collect and process data as described in its own policies. You can control ad personalisation and cookie preferences via <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ad Settings</a>. For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>. We do not control the data practices of these third parties; we encourage you to read their policies.
      </p>

      <h2 id="retention">Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this policy, or as required by law. For example, contact form submissions may be kept for a limited period to handle follow-up; server logs and analytics data may be retained for a period that allows us to analyse trends and maintain security. After that, we delete or anonymise the data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rights">Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have the right to: <strong>Access</strong> your personal data; <strong>Rectification</strong> of inaccurate data; <strong>Erasure</strong> (“right to be forgotten”) in certain cases; <strong>Restriction</strong> of processing; <strong>Data portability</strong>; <strong>Object</strong> to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing; and <strong>Withdraw consent</strong> where processing is based on consent. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a> or via our <a href={`/${ROUTES.en.contact}`}>Contact</a> page.
