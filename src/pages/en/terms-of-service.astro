      <p>
        OBD Fault Codes is an informational website that explains On-Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) trouble codes used in vehicles. We provide code definitions, possible causes, symptoms, and general repair cost ranges for educational and reference purposes only. Our content is not a substitute for professional automotive diagnosis, repair, or inspection. Vehicle systems vary by make, model, and year; only a qualified technician can accurately diagnose and fix your vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee the completeness, accuracy, or suitability of any information on the site for your specific situation. Repair costs, code meanings, and recommended actions may differ depending on your vehicle and location. Always consult a qualified mechanic or authorised service centre before making repair decisions.
